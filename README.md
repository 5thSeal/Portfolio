# Portfolio
Hello, My Name is Jacob Garcia and I am currently a sophomore in College planning to achieve an MBA in Business Administration and Bachelors in Computer Science in the year 2025. Besides attending school full-time, I own a YouTube channel which has over 40,000 subscribers which is my primary source of income. Aside from managing that, I also own a content creation team called Sense in which I lead my members and organize strategies to ensure growth from our channels as a whole. I am interested in becoming a software enginner once I graduate and this portfolio will include the best projects I have completed so far. My current goal at the moment is to get familiar with Java as it is one of the most popular programming languages and build difficult programs in order to gain experience.
